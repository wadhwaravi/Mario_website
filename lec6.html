            Good morning/afternoon everyone , thank you for coming today. Today I want to talk about a topic that affects all of us as consumers: the ongoing debate over whether e-commerce will eventually dominate physical stores. As technology continues to advance and consumer behaviour changes, this topic has become increasingly relevant and important for businesses to consider.
